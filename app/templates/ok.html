        <h2>Page For Help</h2>
        <p>
          In this page, we delve into the development of a web interface for our
          proposed BPELT (Bug Prediction with an Ensemble Learning Tool)
          approach. This interface facilitates the process of predicting
          software bugs by leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance
          prediction accuracy. Using datasets in the ARFF (Attribute-Relation
          File Format) format extracted from the PROMISE NASA repository, which
          is widely recognized in the field of bug prediction, our web interface
          allows users to upload datasets and view prediction results. It also
          provides visualizations in the form of charts and tables to help users
          comprehend the results and make informed decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>0.2 Upload page interface</h2>
        This is the section one for uploading dataset, then split into two parts
        "Training and Testing" the parts are specified according to the needs of
        the user. This is another interface to show summary, the interface is
        displayed after user clicks show summary button.
        <h2>0.3 Apprentissage page interface</h2>
        This is the section number two for train the classifier, the user
        selects the classifier that needs. If the user needs to specify the
        weights, he must check ’Specify weights manually’ in the following
        figure and put the weights according to their choice and check that the
        sum of weights equals 1
        <h2>0.4 Test model page interface</h2>
        This is the section number three for test the model with high accuracy,
        the testing process is done instance by instance . If the user needs to
        display all the characteristics of an instance of the test part, he must
        write the number of the instance and click on the display instance
        characteristics button.

        <h2>0.5 Prediction page interface</h2>

        This is the last section in my interface, it’s for prediction and
        visualization, we display a confu- sion matrix and the classification
        report and the Roc as a result

        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        This page presented the development and implementation of the web
        interface for the Bug Prediction with an Ensemble Learning Tool (BPELT).
        This interface is a critical component of the overall system, designed
        to provide an accessible and user-friendly platform for users to
        interact with the bug prediction model. The chapter detailed the global
        use case diagram and specific use case studies, illustrating how users
        can upload datasets, view prediction results, and make informed
        decisions based on the output generated by the model.\\The interface was
        developed using modern web technologies, ensuring that it is both robust
        and scalable. Key functionalities, such as dataset upload, data
        visualization, and result interpretation, were implemented to enhance
        the user experience and facilitate the practical application of the
        BPELT approach in real-world scenarios. The use case diagrams provided a
        clear understanding of the user interactions and the workflow within the
        system.\\ In conclusion, the development of the web interface
        significantly contributes to the usability and practicality of the BPELT
        model. By offering a streamlined and intuitive platform, the interface
        enables developers to efficiently utilize the bug prediction tool,
        ultimately aiding in the early detection and correction of software
        bugs. This chapter underscores the importance of integrating predictive
        models with user-friendly interfaces to bridge the gap between complex
        machine learning algorithms and their application in everyday software
        development practices. Future enhancements could focus on further
        refining the interface, incorporating additional features, and improving
        overall user engagement and satisfaction.
